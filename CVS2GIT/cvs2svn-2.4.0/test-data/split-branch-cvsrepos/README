It is based on issue-1421-small-cvsrepos.tgz from Blair Zajac. Previously, this
directory contained a different set of test data, which began to pass after a
partial fix in r6534. However, similar errors still occurred with other data
sets. The issue was reopened, and the test data changed to more reliably test
the bug. It continued to fail until the final fix in r7006.

See the issue for more details.
