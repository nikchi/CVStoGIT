This data is for testing the resolution of:

   http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=1427
   "cvs2svn: fails on GtkRadiant repository"

But the data here is not the GtkRadiant data.  Instead, it comes from
Jack Moffitt at xiph.org, who was able to narrow down the same bug to
a much smaller repro set.  It might be possible to narrow it down even
further, I don't know -- too lazy to try right now.  The important
thing is that this data won't convert if revision 6567 is subtracted
from cvs2svn.py.  The error message can look either like this

   ----- pass 3 -----
   ----- pass 4 -----
   committing: Sun Sep  9 21:26:32 2001, over 3 seconds
   No origin records for branch 'xiph'.

or like this

   File "./cvs2svn.py", line 960, in copy_path
       entries)
     File "./cvs2svn.py", line 661, in change_path
       for ent in new_val.keys():
   AttributeError: 'None' object has no attribute 'keys'

the former if no part of the 'xiph' vendor import branch has been
created in the Subversion repository by the time we get to the problem
file, the latter if /branches/xiph/ already exists.  It could go
either way, depending on how Python iterates over dictionary keys.
