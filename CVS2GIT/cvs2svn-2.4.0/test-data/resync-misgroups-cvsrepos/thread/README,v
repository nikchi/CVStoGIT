@This is the cross platform thread and syncronization library.

It depends on the avl library.

This is a massively cleaned and picked through version of the code from
the icecast 1.3.x base.  It has not been heavily tested *YET*.  But since
it's just cleanups, it really shouldn't have that many problems.
