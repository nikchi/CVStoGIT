This repository is for testing that setting of svn:eol-style works as
expected, that the mime mapper also works, and that mime types and eol
styles interact with each other correctly.  Issue #39 has more about
how these interactions work.

The 'mime-mappings.txt' file for this repository is stored right here,
in the repository itself.  It won't be converted because it doesn't
end with ,v.
